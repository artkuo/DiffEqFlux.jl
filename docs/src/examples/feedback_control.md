# Universal Differential Equations for Neural Feedback Control

You can also mix a known differential equation and a neural differential
equation, so that the parameters and the neural network are estimated
simultaneously!

We will assume that we know the dynamics of a system to be controlled (first-order 
linear dynamics), and our goal is to find a neural network that will act as a 
dynamical feedback controller to force the system outputs to stay close to 1.
